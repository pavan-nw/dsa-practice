/**
 * Given an array of integers A, find and return the peak element in it.
 *
 * An array element is peak if it is NOT smaller than its neighbors.
 *
 * For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor.
 *
 * For example, for input array {5, 10, 20, 15}, 20 is the only peak element.
 *
 * Following corner cases give better idea about the problem.
 *
 * 1) If input array is sorted in strictly increasing order, the last element is always a peak element.
 * For example, 5 is peak element in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
 * 2) If input array is sorted in strictly decreasing order, the first element is always a peak element.
 * 10 is the peak element in {10, 9, 8, 7, 6}.
 * Note: It is guranteed that the answer is unique.
 *
 * Input 1:
 *     A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * Output 1:
 *     5
 *
 * Input 2:
 *     A = [5, 17, 100, 11, 6,8,9,7]
 * Output 2:
 *     100
